# Hub for Paletten

This repository contains a small application that is used to monitor and control the temperature in my family's vacation house, mainly to keep it frost free during the winter and preheat it before arriving. See [frontend repository](https://github.com/OliverFlecke/paletten) for related project.

This service is responsible for:

- [x] Collecting temperature and humidity readings from the sensors deployed in the house
- [ ] Serve temperature/humidity data through API
- [x] Monitor current temperature and control heater state based on desired temperature
